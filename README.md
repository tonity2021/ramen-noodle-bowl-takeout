# ramen-noodle-takeout-API
## Project Concept:

This app represents a fast food online reservation system which allows a user to create a ramen noodle bowl to-go order, and view their order via HTTP requests. After creating an order, a user can retrieve their order (by an id order number), update, and delete their order.  On the back-end, this app allows for full CRUD functionality and user information is stored in a PostgreSQL database facilitated by PGAdmin.  

Ultimately I was able to achieve this project through a variety of outside tools: using Word document to track my goals and progress, creating an ERD, and making multiple commits via Git Bash to keep track of recent changes to my project.

•	As a user I can create a new ramen noodle bowl order. <br />
•	As a user I can search for my order via order Id to ensure I’m referencing the correct to-go order.  <br />
•	As a user I can retrieve and view all of my orders when I have ordered multiple times.  <br />
•	As a user I can update/modify my order if I change my mind about anything associated with my order.  <br />

## Challenges

1.)	 One challenge I had was getting past CORS origin errors in order for my front-end port to work with my back-end port for HTTP requests. <br />

2.)	Another issue was facing the challenge of deploying a full-stack project and the harsh learning curve that came with it.<br />

3.)	In addition, a major hurddle was trying to implement user authentication (registering/logging-in) a user on the front-end, although I was able to implement in Java.  <br />

4.)	Last, the task of connecting my front-end Angular app with SpringBoot for the two to communicate effectively, was a major challenge.  <br />
