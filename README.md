# ramen-noodle-takeout-API
## Project Concept:

This app represents a fast food online reservation system which allows a user to create a ramen noodle bowl to-go order, and view their order via HTTP requests. After creating an order, a user can retrieve their order (by an id order number), update, and delete their order.  On the back-end, this app allows for full CRUD functionality and user information is stored in a PostgreSQL database facilitated by PGAdmin.  

Ultimately I was able to achieve this project through a variety of outside tools: using Word document to track my goals and progress, creating an ERD, and making multiple commits via Git Bash to keep track of recent changes to my project.
